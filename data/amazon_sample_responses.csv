Really good , changes into fantastic colours and look great in hurricane jars . Made my life so much easier just by the press of a button , will be looking for more in the future",2. did everyone else got what it looked like in the picture? I just got this solid metal thing that does not  even have a stainless steel finish. It does not  have the black grips they are metal as well. Not only that  the end of it is not  rounded off so you cannot fit it in a horn mouthpiece that is dented inward. I tried uploading a video review but it wont publish to show.,3. I loved the book.  It was very interesting and funny. I like reading about the people and how they lived.  Carole Davis,"4. I thought I would save some money by getting the SwingTip instead of one of the more expensive swing analyzers, hoping the performance of the SwingTip would be good enough.  It was not .  It failed to capture most of my swings, but the biggest downside is that it does not  work for putting, which was a deal breaker for me.",5. After reading the reviews   I decided to give it a try   have only slept on it for 3 nights but so far its doing a good job . Seems to be very well made and I was thrilled to get something made in the USA !,6. My husband got this for our son but it stopped working as we were watching him  play. We did not  see him  do anything that would have been considered abusive at all. I have  seen my husband use our car  steering wheel a lot harsher.,"7. I was satisfied with this one as they were great in sending the item right of way and the price was good, though my computer was old and did not  totally do what I had hope it would.","8. Great appearance. Make sure to order a half size down from what you normally wear. I suggest replacing the inserts as they are stiff. Boot otherwise flexes nicely and is lightweight, namely as the sole is thermal plastic rubber.",9. My crib was out of stock for some time and this was my last resource. I did not  only get it the day promise but it was in great conditions and great style since then its been in great use by my little angel!,10. I just received it it was due by the 13th I m always impressed when my item comes early. Installation was a piece of cake  i am very happy with this item,11. Well made and beautiful. I love the pivoting paper holders.  So much easier than dealing with the spring loaded axle.  You do have to be careful about spacing to prevent the gap when the axle pivots closed.,"12. My acupuncturist recommended eating seaweed and I have been at his house where his wife had these as a snack.  Decided to buy them for myself.  I have had the sesame and wasabi flavors, which are very tasty.  Actually, they re kind of addicting and I found myself eating one piece after another.  Fortunately, the whole pack adds up to only 50 calories. I wanted to comment that I bought the .35 oz pack at WHOLE FOODS here on the East Coast for only  1.33.  Yeah, expensive, generally overpriced WHOLE FOODS   who would have  thought that something there would be less expensive than amazon.com?  The price listed here would be  1.67 per pack. I do not  know if it was on sale or what, but buyers might want to check out WHOLE FOODS first.",13. I was not sure what I wanted and the seller was very helpful. The pillowcases are beautiful and of top quality. I will buy from her,14. These guitar pick punch sheets are very nicely made and so colorful   very strong and durable   Purchased these for a family member and they are very happy with the quality and that they come in three different sizes.,15. Delivered to my door 36 hours from ordering. Easy to unpack and assemble.  Very comfortable and effective in all respects.  Adjustable in all the right ways. I highly recommend.,"16. Being italian, I love to eat a little bit of American Italian food once in a while. Panini is by far my favorite even over pizza. This book has some absolutely great recipes.","17. I first played this on an original SNES about 18 years ago.  I have since lost both system and game (dammit) but have found the wonderful world of emulators.  It  still my go to game for when I m bored or get tired of dying on Call of Duty.  The Ancient Cave is unbeatable, I have yet to find all the Iris Treasures, most of the puzzles are second nature for me now, but when I was eight, it was actually pretty challenging.  It has outstanding game play and the graphics are right on par with the others at the tI am e.  1996 was quite some tI am e ago and even though there were a few games to push the barrier (StarFox, Secrets of Mana, etc) it was right on par with all the others.  Turn based RPG  were the heat for me so this obviously meets the mark.  I think it is a shame that they followed it up with Lufia but whats done is done.  Bottom line: one of my top 3 games of all tI am e and an all around good play for all ages.","18. This fit surprisingly well, and I like that it has the stretchy bottom hem to it. It is helping keep this cover on securely, especially since it has been really stormy lately. So far, no mold or mildew or damage to the cover. I really enjoy it so far.",19. This replaces an intex paper filter system that came with my above ground 12 x 24 saltwater pool.  This is a great replacement.  Easy to use and excellent suction.  Moves the water much better and is easy to clean.  Does a much better job of filtration. I have a connection directly to an underground drainage system and flush the filter into that.  Works great and I recommend it strongly.,"20. I would not recommend this product if you plan on using them together. I put the screen protector on and when I went to put the rear protector on, it buckled the screen protector. You have to have the protector perfectly on and even so I m not sure you can still put the rear protector on.",21. Fits well with my rode as well as my audiotechnica shotgun mic. I really like it. It  a very effective wind canceller.,22. This was a replacement lens. The original lens was cracked from a drop of the camera so I kind of knew what I was getting. Happily satisfied.,"23. I bought this for my 10 year old son and he absolutely loved it. The controller is easy to use and the helicopter flies pretty high. My son uses this in the backyard and takes it to go camping and the beach. The toy is extremely durable and portable. It has a light that flashes and the battery life is pretty long. My son could not  be any happier with this toy. In fact, my husband plays with it as well. Shipping was fast and I plan on buying one more for my nephew for his upcoming birthday",24. I also believe the Q  will be more durable. The plastic headband on the Solo  breaks WAY TO EASY! Stay away from the hype and get this better product. My only complaint is the length of the cords.,"25. I am a teacher at a local school. I found this book very interesting and useful. I learn a lot from this book about teaching and life as a teacher from this book. Other than this book   ASIN:B00F8TD88Y Inspired to Inspire: 1,200 Inspirational quotes and sayings for Teachers   Educators   is the only other book I found as good as this particular book for professional teachers.","26. I read another review of this watch indicating that there may be issues with the quality of the links. When I got the watch I took it over to our jeweler so that she could check that everything was okay. She found several screws in the band that were very loose. It was an easy fix, but still makes me nervous about the overall quality.",27. Fog lights and switch look just like oem and work very good if ur looking for fog lights this is the kit to buy,"28. It is a very nice and powerful small LED bulb with a decent price. I used it to replace my old incandescent lights in my kitchen. They are very bright, in my opinion, with a good color temperature to fit my application. Moreover, they started saving money for me on electric bill from the day one. I like the  energy saving  idea and I am considering to replace all my incandescent light with LED. I just need to spend some tI am e t figuring out which LED light is compatible. I accidently placed two orders and asked seller to cancel one. To my surprise, their reply e mail showed up in my e mail within 2 hours. Amazing service    I d like to keep buying from them.",29. Love these shoes!!! Can wear   walk in them all day long. Glad I bought 3 pairs. Now I can retire the pair I got in 2005!!,"30. My hubby Dub is something of a handy man and he had no problem installing this bathroom faucet. We re a Moen home actually, we have a Moen faucet in the kitchen and now we have one in both bathrooms. Moen makes kitchen and bathroom faucets that are like works of art. This one is sI am ply gorgeous.","31. Arrived quickly and expertly packaged. Very easy to use. I started using it right out of the box. I am having a lot of fun with it. The instructions could use some work, but it was still pretty sImple to figure out :)",32. These are good but keep sliding down and that makes it uncomfortable to workout with. also the edges are rough and that hurts the ankle.,33. i am very passionate for my hobby. i am glad that i bought this tool. otherwise i would have not been able to take my hobby forward. best ever tool i have used in my life. packing was soo good. and the best part is the tool is very easy to us.,"34. I bought this  as a way to get myself to exercise. I am thin and healthy but I HATE working out. This turned out to be much more difficult than I expected. I had hoped that there would be several components that would be easy for anyone and that I could work my way up to the more challenging parts. Well even the so called warm up just about killed me. I fell like I am too old (61) for this and will never be able to keep up with the intense pace of Zumba. I guess I should have bought a Richard SI am mons Sweatin to the Oldies DVD instead. LOL Buy this if you are already pretty fit to add to your arsenal of workouts. If you are old and out of shape, this is too hard for you.","35. Perfect solution for a multi purpose gadget. It functions really well, and the quality is great. It is very user friendly, which I am happy with because I am not tech savvy at all. I have used the spy cam for all the purposes it is intend for, and done so with ease. I gave this product a throe work over and am very happy with the way it functions.  Review product",36. I had the until only about 6 months and the cord stopped working.  So frustrating.  Had to buy a new cord.,37. Just received a product with one of the edge bent. Box was clean but product was damaged...return it right away.It totally waste my time.,"38. I have a Marshall JCM 800 50 Watt head and two cabinets that I use in my hard rock band. Needless to say, I use a whole bunch of overdrive and play loud. The worst problem I had with this setup was the loud hiss that would be produced when I was not  playing because I have the gains turned up so high. To remedy this, I had to walk over to my rig and hit the   34;Standby,  34; button. Now all I have to do is hit the DecI am ator II pedal and the hiss is gone. I am running it through my effects loop.",39.  I do not  know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR with the minimum number of words they want on all reviews!!!!  Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth!!!!!!,"40. The quality and taste of this green tea is phenomenal. I love making a cup of this tea for breakfast   it is soothing and tastes good. It  also good after dinner, to help relax and de stress. This tea is organic and non gmo, carefully prepared and packaged. I really appreciate the fact that it does not contain pesticides. It is pure and clean, with a mild green flavor. I dont add any sugar or sweetner to my hot tea, although some people like it sweet. To create a frappe, I mix it with coconut milk and ice cubes in the vitamixer. Highly recommended if you like Green Matcha tea.","41. My son has been wanting a skateboard, and he wanted the expensive ones like the Penny board, it was a little bit over my price tag and i wanted something that had the same build but cheaper. THen i found this, when i got the item after its assembly, i was surprised that the build quality is really good and the price is reasonable. Great buy","42. My office at work has a nice professional phone system with a wireless headset so I can type while I m on calls. Things are a little more sparse at home though. I have a wireless handset that I can set on speaker or my iPhone. Neither one of them sound very good on speakerphone though.This Bluetooth speaker is perfect for phone meetings. It quickly paired up with my iPhone. Now I can use it for playing music from my iPhone or even better I can make very clear hands free calls from my desk. Just switch on the speaker to connect my phone to Bluetooth, then place the call over the speaker. I can hear the caller very clearly and the caller can hear my voice just fine. I m glad this Bluetooth speaker has solved my problem.I think it is a very great Bluetooth speaker.Worth recommending!","43. I used to travel as a tour guide in different beautiful spots and I find this travel charger most helpful. It provides numerous different outlet options to suit your needs. I easily charged phone, computer, tablet, and camera with no worries at all. The price is worthy. I love this item very much!",44. I use this on my son  mattress and it works great. I would say if you have kids this is something to keep.,"45. Perfect for hanging guitars, or other similar instruments.  Padding holds guitar nicely and firmly.  Protects the neck of my guitar.  Great way to have quick access to your instrument. Well made. Great buy for the price.",46. Lost one of the rollers when we moved an I ordered this to replace the lost one. Worked great. The service was great received very fast too. Thank you!!,"47. Great, light weight luggage. I normally worry about my luggage being overweight because I always over pack. Not this trip   I actually had room to spare for gifts to bring home   not to mention ten pounds to play with because the luggage is so lightweight..","48. Exactly what I was looking for and bigger than expected! It holds SO MUCH. It is a strong backpack. Love the design, so classical. Fast shipping also!! Thank you.","49. I got a completely diffrent sheep to what i ordered. I ordered this plush soft sheep and got a colourful ganster looking stuffed toy. I did not  even bother to try and return it   was not worth the hassle. This is the second time i got a wrong order from Amazon. But they have good cusotmer service so far, so I did not  make an issue.","50. This is a great garment bag for a wedding dress.  It has enough room for the train and the extra width at the bottom is great.  The only drawback is that it is not completely opaque.  You can see some detail of the dress, especially if the bag is held up to a light source.  Overall, I like it and am sure it will be useful for traveling to my wedding.",51. These shapewear briefs are more affordable then other brands I considered buying. They offer more support and control. I love the high waist design because it gives me more tummy control and helps define my hips more. They are comfortable to wear and do not  leave lines when you put your pants skirts or whatever you are wearing over top,52. Wonderful film. Inaritu has made a cinematic masterpiece. The characters are deep and the cinematography creates an intI am ate experience with them. I loved every minute.,"53. I love it. It fits really well in the driver  seat. I m not used to driving long distances that  why I ordered this one for back support. I tried it first on my computer chair and it really feels comfortable. I like the material of the cover made too. It  soft and very nice material. I tried it on the driver  seat as well and it  perfect. It helps me relaxed my back do not  need to actually pull the driver  seat forward. I think I made a great decision in buying this Lumbar cushion. The only thing that I m worried is the durability of this cushion. I think it  good if you do not  use it too much because I feel like it  not hard enough not to sag after couple years. I hope I m wrong. But you know what, it  perfect for the present and for probably the coming whole year.","54. Did not  know to much about Sceptre but took a chance at it , picture qualiy is great,set up took mins and sound is great!","55. I was very excited when I got this last month as it fits my dogs  crate beautifully. However, not excited any longer as there is   34;fleece shedding  34; everywhere. Very thin and poorly made. Last straw was today seeing my dog was able to destroy it and remove ALL the filling. Do not recommend it.",56. I bought this for my mom for her birthday. She really loved it and its really beautiful. I would maybe get a longer chain but other than that it was exactly what I I am agined.,57. This is meant for little dogs that cannot jump that high I think. Big ones just leap over it like it was nothing.,"58. We got this to use in our vacation rental. We were already out of town so my dad who is an engineer thought it would be easy enough to set. Not so. Then our property manager and her husband tried, same thing. So we finally came home and my husband played with it. It took a couple of hours but we think it may be set the way we want it now. Just not user friendly to me.",59. Whats not to LOVE  Love anything with Valerie Harper. Rhoda is a friend to everyone and Valerie Harper is truly gifted and a wondeful person.,"60. cant go wrong with original manufacturer items.  good controller, fits perfect in the hand i even use it on my computer","61. Does not  do a bad job of keeping things running a bit cooler when I m working the CPU (usually compiling), not sure how well it would work for laptops with larger screens though (using it with a 15.4 ).","62. It fits my Santa Fe 2007 perfectly, and costs less than half than the original replacement the dealer offered me. In fact, I think they are the same.","63. I needed a simple phone to go on the wall where an old wall phone was removed. This looked OK out of the box at first sight. Then, even at Amazon  cheap price, phone not worth the money. Very cheaply made. When hung on wall the receiver falls off the hook. Best thing about this purchase was AMAZON! I contacted them and they refunded my money I am mediately and told me to dispose of the phone. It was so nice not have to go through the hassle of a return. THANKS AMAZON!",64. Just received the lamp and it is very cool! I will probably order another one for my husband  bedside table and may give some for Christmas as well! I LOVE the fact that I do not  have to replace light bulbs. You can buy it without hesitation.,"65. Great tumbler, but I was slightly disappointed when I received it because the picture made it seem taller. It is shorter than you think.",66. The audio quality from this microphone is amazing. I use it mostly for recording some really bad singing but my voice almost sounds tolerable when I used this microphone.,"67. This is a really nice looking organizer    I underestI am ated the sizes of the compartments.  I planned on removing the divider between the 8 compartments to allow storage space for 8.5 x 11 paper.  The craftmanship will not allow that.  Again, it  a really attractive piece!","68. These are relatively small sized diamond bits. I use them to drill holes in glass for making lamps out of wine bottles. They work just fine and I am very satisfied with their performance. The trick is to keep them wet, and figure you are going to get a little messy using them. You may want to experI am ent with them to get the hang of it. Keeping the bit on position can be tough when you first start.","69. Well made, smart looking bag. However, there  only about a 75  chance it will fit under any given seat in economy. After traveling extensively for a full year, I have yet to find a seat that it fits under easily, without having to be squished and shoved mightily (an entertaining spectacle for one  seatmates). Unfortunately this rough handling this leads to undue wear and tear on the bag, making it look beat up well before a bag of its quality should with normal use. Additionally, when full the bag is a bit unwieldy and heavy for lifting into the overhead bin on the occasions where it does not  fit under the seat. The back up bag is smart looking as well and has proven very useful; in fact I use it more often than the wheelie bag.  I would not  recommend this bag unless you are a strapping gentleman (or lady) who does not  mind hoisting this into the overhead bins on the not infrequent occasion that it does not  fit under the seat, and is willing to deal with the inconvenience of shoving it under your seat on all other occasions.  Here  a chart of some common  under seat  carry ons. Only the first three are true  under seat  bags for the purposes of the economy class traveler. The Eagle is the most reliable in terms of fitting under the greatest number of seats, however its smaller dI am ensions mean it can carry less things. Choose according to your personal preference:)  Eagle 13   H, 13   W, 8 T Travelon 14 H 13.5 W x 8.5 T Magellan 14   H, 12   W, 8   T  Samsonite 18   H, 14   W, 7   T Hammacher Schlemmer 14   H, 15   W, 9   T",70. I have always been self conscious about my uneven skin tone I was excited to find this high hyaluronic acid serum that would correct it. I enjoy the feeling that this product gives me. It is not  oily or greasy. I can actually feel my skin being hydrated.  I am very sensitive to smell and this product does not have a strong smell. I do like the use of the dropper that gives you just the right amount of serum to use. In my opinion this product is very well worth the money and it is the best.,"71. This is a handy holder dispenser for wipes. The opening is large enough that it  easy to insert the wipes. Although the handle would be useful for a stroller, I like to put mine in the glove compartment of my car so no handle needed. OXO is a brand to be trusted with quality and functionality.","72. The clasp closure of the earring is not aligned properly thus, it does not close properly. When I am wearing the earrings I have to keep touching them to make sure they are still in my ears. I am not sure if the one I got was defective but I find it does not have a strong safety closure.","73. Great addition for our camping trips equipment, the emitted is LED so that makes the power and quality of the light to be very strong, the fan is perfect for that moment in the night when you cannot sleep because of the heat. I used it in our last camping trip with my son and it lasted all night long, which is great considering it is batteries what power this. It also is very lightweight which is something we were looking for, as we like to pack light. Overall, is a very useful tool for the camping amateurs like my son and I","74. Personally I did not care for this camera when combined with my compatible Panasonic TV. Quite simply the quality was terrible. I stream other video content on my TV but when talking to my brother in Japan, the video quality was just terrible. I realize this is more a function of the TV, not the camera, but since there  so few models it works with, and I am not about to go out and buy another TV to try it with, this is a big consideration.  I also did not  like the wide screen view it uses at all. Great I guess if you have a big family, but my couch is at a distance that I end up being barely visible to the caller. I did not  see an easy way to zoom in or adjust the angle when I am sitting on the floor for instance.  Overall, it just did not  give me any benefits over using Skype on my iMac or iPad or iPhone, etc. Really the only reason I guess you would get this is if you routinely want to make calls with a large number of people on one camera.",75. If you love hedgehog memorabilia this fits the bill. I could not believe how cute these are..detail awesome..color fantastic.thanks to the vendor right on the mark,"76. This ball does and always has flown straigt, far and fast. The enjoyment is second to almost none and it  as durable as you would expect a Nerf. Maybe more so.",77. Awesome Boot. I bought two pair one of me and one for my 20 Year old Son. We both agree these are extremely comfotable and durable. Great Price as well on Amazon!,"78. Perfect for a crazy busy little girl!  They get banged around so the price point is perfect knowing how quickly they grow out of them.  Easy to slide on and off, excellent quality and construction.  We have  purchased two pairs already...and will continue to buy more as she grows to the next size.",79. I was very pleased with this organizer.  The drawer was a bit bigger than I expected.  The division are nice size and can hold a variety of items.  The lipstick slots are great for the slightly larger than normal lipsticks I own. I am very pleased.,80. Got these sticks for my son who is a drummer..and he loves them! The 7A drum sticks are his favorite. The price was right too!,"81. I jumped the gun on this 4K TV, yes, the picture is pretty, yes, its got a fancy look to it, but when it all boils down to it, its just a    higher  definition TV that you barely notice a difference after a while, I bought mine in Best Buy and side by side you can see the difference when compared to a 1080P set, but once home and set up, its meh. For the price I paid I could have bought 3 1080P LEDs TVs but had to have the new stuff first. I halt from giving it 5 stars due to the price and what it really is capable of so far, in terms of 4K content, which for the time being, is pretty much non existant, but hey, I got bragging rights!",82. These do fits perfectly and as I expected them to be. Usually when I get the same size it  like they re not going fit close and comfortable enough for me. I love the fact that I can rock these any everywhere no matter what. These are simply perfect enough for me. The material is amazing and you can tell that they are of good quality.,83. I am going to cry when this poor thing finally gives up the ghost. Not that it will do it any time soon though. It is a rugged bag.  I put way too much stuff in it and still it looks good. It has compartments for everything.  The double straps makes it comfortable to carry over your shoulder or in your hand. It makes a difference having this option. It makes the bag useable in all situations.  I could not ask for a better bag.,84. It is wonderful book for childs. I have purchased one my 6 year daughter Tina. She really liked the story when I read it for her. Marianna Bergues wrote the story with care I admit it. Must appreacited book for childs.,"85. The taste is pretty okay, but obviously not as good as your boba store, but this is really bad for you. It has so much sugar and additives. Beware for your health if you order this product.","86. Excellent product for a great price. Item looks new and functions perfectly as described. Item shipped quickly and works very well. Plus, 90 day warranty is a bargain deal.",87. Total quality. Great features. Great fit. Should last years. Totally satisfied with this product. Very fast delivery too.,88. I have just purchased lipo blast extreme and am very excited about losing some pounds before summer! I have a little concern though because I have not seen any recent reviews on this product. Anybody recently used this product and pleased with it?,89. Pretty nice. Bag is attached so you do not  lose it. Is made well. Have not  used yet but do not  see why there would be a problem. Should of been stakes for it included in case your in a spot the does not  have sand.,"90. These saved my sanity.  Again, not available at your typical Homeless Despot.  Pro tip.  Rub a little candle wax on the threads before using.  I do this to all my screws now.","91. Bought this for my 14 year old daughter who likes to write. She loves it and we have fun just reading some of the hilarious topics. It  obviously written for adults, but I think most teens would appreciate the humor as well.  Its a great tool for teachers and writers.","92. We purchased this as a requirement for our daughter  swim  class and found that these are waaaaaay better than the swim ming disposable diapers. It definitely does contain 100  of well, anything   solid or liquid. And is so much less bulky than the disposable versions. They also do not  soak up 20 lbs. of water either :)",93. I owned a previous Sunnytech flag light but wanted something brighter. I saw this new version from Sunnytech and thought that maybe they I am proved the brightness. But the brightness is about the same. I will send this light back for refund.,"94. Great case, a little bulky. But helps to prop iPad in different positions while using and it is steady. I do use it a lot; lasting longer than other one I have no wear and tear on edges. It  good","95. The official is the perfect, but if you cannot find that one, you can go for this one blindfolded, it works same as the original one and if anyone is not happy with the product, no worries Amazon is giving the funds back, by the way, I am happy with mine, no need to refund.","96. No it  not a blockbuster film, and it is weak at times. But It  art made by people that believe. Some of these 1 star reviews are not helpful at all, This Review system sucks anyway. Anybody with a hair across their ass can take it out on some artist. You paid  2.99 get over it big spenders. Yes, the movie should be better. I paid  2.99 and would not stoop as low as you guys to bash it that bad! No class!","97. If we are talking about LCD HD televisions the only brand that may be considered for me is the LG. I bought my first LG many many years ago and I have had never problems with this television brand. I wish it will not change in the future. Our family like watching films in the evening together so we have a large one in the living room and 3 smaller in the bedrooms. This version is good for the bedroom according to my opinion.  The srceen is very beautiful, the colors are so realistic, the resolution is 1080 pixels. This is more than enough for a home movie watching.","98. This Symphony Tech Guitar Stand is amazing! It folds into a very compact and neat piece of equipment of approxI am ately 12  34; long and less than 4  34; wide. That means that I can easily put it into my instrument bag or backpack. And it  so lightweight and easy for me to take along wherever I go, which is a real plus. Also storage is such a cinch. This stand works great for my guitar as well as some of my other string instruments. Its very sturdy and has great grip, so I know that my instrument will stay in place.

The AVerMedia Live Gamer Extreme also comes with the Cover Creator software, alowing you to create and print your own, custom cover I am age. It is the best gamming capture card on the market. The setup is really easy and I definitely recommend this device for who wants to upload and stream their video gamming sessions.",101. I am a heavy user of dried chives and this was an excellent value. The bag is re sealable and stores well.,"102. I do not  like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim   fantastic performance. Just discovering him  made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it  not a particularly great or even interesting movie.  Unlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet does not  rise above its material.  Also (and this may seem petty, but it  my review so I can write whatever I want to), there  a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan I am itation. Another reviewer thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.  It  not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song   it  a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song. How dare he? and how dare they give him  an international venue for his plagiarism? If they want a Dylan song, dig up the cash and use a real one, not a cheap fake. I m still angry about that.  So I recommend this movie ONLY for Rahim  fantastic performance. I m going to watch whatever other movies with him  are available and hope they have something to offer in addition to him , because great acting in mediocre movies only goes so far.","103. My husband just purchased this bag for me. I was so excited to get it,but once I opened it up there is printing on the inside of it. Like another pattern was bleeding through on the bag. When you hold it in sunlight it looks like the bag is dirty on the white parts of the chevron pattern. I m very disappointed in this and would like to return it but I have  opened it up. I was planning on ordering more but now I wo not !!  Please be aware!!","104. Good monitor for the price. Met all my expectations. I like the glossy display because videos and movies look more crisp than matte.  Cons: Would have been nice to have a display port. Speakers suck as all monitor speakers do. Why do they bother putting them in? No one ever uses them.  Overall, happy with the purchase. It was delivered safe and quickly.",105. I was expecting to have trouble assembling this rack from past reviews.  I had NO PROBLEM.  Went together easily.  Very sturdy stand and very attractive.  I m so glad I ordered it!  Instructions are easy to follow.,106. Good quality and just fits.  Keeps things from tipping.  Now I know this is a special item but I knocked off one star because they re a little pricey I thought.  Perfect execution though.,107. Holy crap this is great! I love the coffee since it taste unbelievably good but I love the fact that the cups being used are 97  biodegradable. I m a huge environment freak and this gives me a lot of pleasure.,108. I do not  know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your tI am e reading this as I am my waisting tI am e doing them a FAVOR with the minI am um number of words they want on all reviews!!!!  Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth!!!!!!,"109. Ring is very cute, however it is very crooked.  The ring sits across your finger on a diagnal.  If you have any ocd tendencies, this is not the ring for you!",110. This is an amazing collection with a lot of interesting bits that I   ve already seen but not in such great quality! The video and audio were all pitch perfect and nothing was out of line!,"111. I have a full set of copper cookware that hangs over my sink on a rack. I have  had it for 35 years and while I rarely (if ever use it) I like the look of it hanging there. It gets pretty grimey and tarnished and some spots are I am possible to clean. I looked forward to this product, but found that it did not clean very well. Maybe if I spent an hour rubbing and rubbing it might do the job, but with 14 pieces who has the tI am e and the 1,000 rags paper towels. So I cleaned my set using that old faithful since 1882 Bar Keeper  Friend and then cleaned with Maas and yes, more tarnish came off. And it was worth recleaning and there is something in Maas that keeps the tarnish away longer than anything else. Perhaps it is because you do not  use water to  clean  it off that protects the shine. So I am happy enough with that.",112. If you like the aroma of the coconut oil then you will definitely like this product. Personally I like the aroma of the coconut oil but my body does not  seem to be able to deal with it well. Therefore I have stopped buying it anymore.,113. I ordered these pads when I could not find ones suitable at the pharmacy. My wife had complete knee replacement surgery and needed to use a walker for several weeks. Crutcheze Deep Purple Walker Pads. The bonus......These pads added a POP of color to the gray walker.....Accessorize. m,"114. We love this couscous.    I do not follow the cooking instructions on the container. After trial and error, I have found that equal parts water couscous works best. Add the couscous to boiling water, sI am mer it for 5 minutes, remove from the heat and let it sit for another 3, covered.",115. Not at all what I expected. Would not recommend. The tent poles were flI am sy and barely held the light material of the tent up. Not good for a twin bed or the floor. A waste of money!,116. My cat loves this tree! She can always be found sleeping on the top. I bought this for her since we also have two dogs. I wanted to make sure she had a place to get away from them!,117. Bent on the very first day of use.  Our friends had a similar item that was made of much thicker plastic and worked much better. I would not recommend this item.,"118. The steel frame is strong and it  not easy to bend, and it is an I am portant item to have while having lunch in the outside since there are many things to worry about, like flies and unhygienic insects that could ruin the meal.","119. well packaged and on time like the product.  I want to continue buying this product, I believe this is a good choice.","120. Works with my 11 inch Macbook Air! I was concerned since I have only two USB ports and each on opposite sides of my laptop, but I only plugged in one USB and it works just fine. I love that it does not  have to plugged in to an outlet.  Just plug into your laptop and start burning.  I did not  need to set up nothing, no installation disk, NOTHING.  I absolutely love it. Its sleek, slim , light weight and works like a dream....just like my Air  ))  Cheap too!!...unlike my Air! LOL",121. LIfe is random ! There is no rhyme or reason for the good to be loaded down with bad luck and the I am moral rewarded.  There is added humor to this film plus a plot to murder. Another Woody Allen KEEPER !!!,122. I bought this projector for my daughter who uses it at college. She loves the portability and small size of the machine. She was surprised at how clear the sound was   the volume of the speakers. We assumed we would need to purchase an additional speaker system but that  not the case. Definitely worth the money I paid for it!,"123. I have been using these with my iMac instead of Wifi for the last couple months and I have to say I am extremely I am pressed. I stream Netflix to my computer without the problems I used to have with my Wifi connection and I was using an Apple Airport Extreme. If you want to speed up your internet and do not  want to run new wires and if you have cable connections in your house, then this is the way to go.","124. Like many others with Comcast service, I get much better reception on my coax line in the living room than I do in the bedroom upstairs.  The same HDTV will see 47 channels in the living room including all free HD stations (which is really what I want) but only 30 33 stations in the bedroom.  I had high hopes for this unit, but it only I am proved the signal enough for the TV to recognize 36 (3 6 more) channels in the bedroom.  Unfortunately I m still not getting the stations I really want.  Even still, I might keep and use the unit because I think it would boost the signal enough to help with some of the flakier stations in the living room, but it runs really hot and does not  work at all when it  not plugged in (so I cannot unplug it when I leave the house without disabling my webcam).  So I m very disappointed and will look for other solutions.  It  possible I got a defective unit.",125. At first glance this appears to be a fancy custom ended cord. It is a quality molded cord and it works just fine connecting my Amazon MP3 player (my Cell Phone) to my home surround sound aux input.,"126. Hi  This is a wonderful product.  If has made walking my dogs a pleasure again.  Before the sporn pet halter my arms ached and I put off walking the dogs, now cannot wait to go for walkies.  I have recommended this product to several friends. I do see that there is a chance of fraying on the part of the halter that locks it down to the correct.  I do not  know if I have been careless adjusting it or it  just a small flaw.  If it  a problem later on I will  buy another, believe me worth it.",127. Mine are way darker then the picture shown closer to an amethyst color then the red pink plum color pictured. Not pleased,128. Great mattress! I absolute love this mattress but the only negative above this product is the mattress cover. Had a small wine accident and washed it and it is the most difficult thing to put back on because the memory.,129. I was very much surprised when I got the watch. It was really lovely. I use it as my dress watch and work watch. Very happy with my buy.,"130. The diamond saws cut through the granite pretty quickly. You have to keep it very cool, I used a water spray bottle for cooling as I cut the hole. Without the coolant, they will wear out quickyl. No problems so far. These are not the professional type that lasts 300 holes, but for a do it your selfer, like myself, this is good enough. I do not  need a diamond hole saw to do 300 holes. That said I think I will get a very good number of holes out of one of each saw Provided, you keep it cool while drilling. This kit has all the sizes I needed and more. I would buy this set again if I had to do it over.","131. We bought this for my three kids to play around with in the basement. Nice preset musical modules play rhythm that they just play along to. It is pretty amazing that this is still being used six months after Christmas with no sign of slowing! And the kids are actually getting pretty good at drums, especially my youngest, I think he is going to become a musician.","132. We bought this for a relative.  I recently went over to visit and the TV looks amazing.  The colors and textures are real nice, overall good quality.  They have not  had any problems with it  Will look at LG TVs when searching for TVs in the future.","133. Good but could be deeper so a toddlers bottom and legs are further back. Also the back could be higher. Definitely a quick and easy solution to the book stacking of years ago, and reasonable price. Best feature is it collapses easily to be stored in a closet.","134. Really like these.The glasses are comfortable and look good. Totally cute too, not too large and not too small. Just right!","135. This is hands down the best sales bag I have  ever owned in 15 years of medical sales.  It is lightweight, has just the right amount of compartments, and looks great. It is not as shiny as it appears in the picture.",136. I bought this for my golden retriever. It has worked really well and removes a lot of excess fur.good item and recommend it.,"137. Really helps with curbing food cravings. No negative side effects so far. Works as advertised. What can I say, great product!","138. They warm your legs, yes. But they are not  comfortable at all. They feel scratchy and their color is not as I expected it to be.","139. Substantial fixture, very heavy and looks great. At first, I was a little skeptical it would be cheaply made or mostly plactic because of the  reasonably cheap price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of craftsmanship! It is made of all chrome and brass, with no plastic on the actual wand. I do not aggree with other reviewers, the hose is very well constructed and does not have any spots or rust, and likes flat against the wall because of the rotating connectors on both ends.  This shower completes a modern shower, highly recommend!","140. good wash for body. I very happy with smell of item and amount i get in me package. good smell, good service, i be back when running out"
