At first, I was a little skeptical it would be cheaply made or mostly plactic because of the  reasonably cheap price, but I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of craftsmanship! It is made of all chrome and brass, with no plastic on the actual wand. I do not aggree with other reviewers, the hose is very well constructed and does not have any spots or rust, and likes flat against the wall because of the rotating connectors on both ends.
